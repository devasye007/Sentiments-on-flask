Product Requirements Document (PRD)

Project Name: Customer Sentiment Analysis Web App


Overview:
In any business customer feedback is always important to take into consideration,
is the pain point they are talking about worth your time to work on?
Are they pointing out the rabbit holes that you have missed on your services and products ?


Target User:
Stakeholders and Product Designers


Objective:
Build a simple web application that performs sentiment analysis on user-input
text using Python and Flask. The app will classify text as positive, neutral,
or negative using a pre-trained sentiment analysis model (VADER from NLTK)


Skills required
    AI Engineering
    web app development with Flask


Purpose:
To create a functional sentiment analysis tool that helps users
understand the sentiment of their text inputs in real-time via a web interface.


Success Metrics:
    Functional Flask app running locally and accessible via browser
    Accurate sentiment classification using AI
    User-friendly interface with input box and sentiment result display


Features & Requirements
Core Features:
    Text input form on a web page
    Backend sentiment analysis using NLTKâ€™s VADER model
    Display sentiment result (positive, neutral, negative) on the same page
    Basic styling for usability (Bootstrap or similar)


Technical Requirements:
    Use Python 3.x and Flask framework
    Use NLTK library for sentiment analysis (VADER lexicon)
    HTML templates with Jinja2 for rendering pages
    Clear, commented code for learning purposes
    Simple error handling for empty or invalid inputs


Non-Functional Requirements:
    Run on local machine (localhost) on a specified port (e.g., 8088)
    Lightweight and fast response time
    Code modularity for easy understanding and extension
    Gain experience with frontend-backend interaction
    Develop debugging and documentation skills


Deliverable
    Fully functional Flask app with sentiment analysis
    Source code with comments and README explaining setup and usage
    Short report on learnings and challenges faced during the project
